## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it **privately**.

- Preferred: use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting (Security Advisories) for this repository.
- If private reporting is not available, contact the maintainers directly before opening any public issue.

Please include as much detail as possible:

- Affected component(s) and version/commit
- Reproduction steps or proof of concept
- Impact assessment (confidentiality, integrity, availability)
- Suggested mitigation, if known

## Disclosure Process

- We will acknowledge receipt as quickly as possible.
- We will investigate, assess severity, and plan a fix.
- We aim to coordinate disclosure after a patch or mitigation is available.
- Please avoid public disclosure until maintainers confirm it is safe to do so.

Thank you for helping keep Caker and its users secure.
